# This is me learning how different
# Data Structures work

# Array/List
#   Definition: A list is an ordered collection of elements, 
#   which can be of any type. Lists are mutable, 
#   meaning their content can be changed.

# Key Operations:
#   Append: Add an element to the end of the list.
#   Insert: Insert an element at a specific position.
#   Remove: Remove the first occurrence of an element.
#   Pop: Remove an element by index (default is the last item).
#   Slice: Extract a portion of the list.
#    List Comprehension: Create a new list by applying an expression to each element.

# Tuple 
#  Definition: A tuple is an immutable,
#  ordered collection of elements. Once a tuple is created,
#  its values cannot be changed.

#  Key Operations:
#  Access: Similar to lists, you can access tuple elements by index.
#  Unpacking: You can unpack tuples into variables.
#  Concatenation: Combine tuples into a new tuple.

# Dictionary
#   Definition: A dictionary is an unordered collection 
#   of key-value pairs. Keys must be unique and immutable,
#   but values can be of any type and are mutable.

# Key Operations:
#  Insert/Update: Add or modify key-value pairs.
#  Delete: Remove a key-value pair.
#  Lookup: Retrieve a value by key.
#  Keys: Get all keys in the dictionary.
#  Values: Get all values in the dictionary.
